## App Endpoints
Open your API testing tool and hit this endpoint
- GET: `/api/v1/marcel/login` to login into the marcel server.


## Test The Automation
- ***Please note that you should have a Chrome browser installed before trying this out***. </br>
The snippet code below enables a headless call to the Chrome browser. </br>
This basically means that the browser is hidden by default. 
```
self.options.add_argument('headless')
```
However, you can navigate to the ```marcel.py``` file inside the ```src/app/platforms``` directory and
comment the code snippet by add a ```#``` character in order to see the full automation on the browser. 
See example below:
```
# self.options.add_argument('headless')
```

- **After commenting the code snippet, run the following commands on your terminal to start the automation:**
  - Goto the root of the project ie.: ```YOUR_FILE_PATH/WHM-automation/```
  - Run the following and see the automation.
  ***Please note that you can use ```python``` or ```python3``` in the commands. It's based on what you have installed.***
  ```
  python3 src/runner.py
  ```
  - Kill ```ctrl + c``` the terminal after to close the session. <br />


 Final Note: ***Please uncomment the code snippet that you commented above before testing out the endpoints.***
